#
# The Deck class should have a deal method to deal a single card from the deck
# After a card is dealt, it is removed from the deck.
# There should be a shuffle method which makes sure the deck of cards has all 52 cards and then rearranges them randomly.
# The Card class should have a suit (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades) and a value (A,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K)
